### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


I'm AgustÃ­n Pieve, a committed and continuously growing Full Stack Developer. I have always stood out for my soft skills, such as effective and empathetic communication, proactiveness, teamwork, and empathetic listening.

I pursued a career as a Full Stack Developer, where I worked on projects involving Javascript, React-Redux, TailwindCss, Next.js, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, Sequelize, and PostgreSQL. I would like to highlight Finder Service, a web app that I developed with a team of six people using the SCRUM methodology and tools like Figma, Gitflow, and Trello.

My IT education has led to significant growth as a developer, as well as in values such as discipline, leadership, decision-making, and a constant willingness to take on new challenges driven by a desire for continuous learning and improvement in these areas. I believe I can be a valuable addition to any organization in the Tech industry.
